"description":"Until recently, little has been written about Vermont during the Great Depression. Two major and now classic scholarly works addressed some aspects of the era. Richard M. Judd's New Deal in Vermont covers a broad expanse of time and focuses on the major political events and the players who shaped New Deal legislation in Vermont. Elin Anderson's We Americans offers a remarkably insightful look at patterns of social interaction between Burlingtonians of varying social and ethnic identities ca. 1930, but does little to convey the overall reality of Depression-era life throughout the state.

"description":"With the decline of the Grange movement during the early part of the twentieth century, new instruments were developed to sustain the vitality of Vermont’s agricultural community. The Smith-Lever Act, passed by Congress in 1914 to provide for “the advancement of agriculture,” funded the fledgling Vermont Extension Service, operating under the aegis of the University of Vermont. Monies were channeled into three broad program areas, each to be administered by the Extension Service. The first was designed to promote extensive agricultural experimentation, the second sponsored “home demonstrations” across the state to acquaint farm families with innovations in “scientific” farming, and the third organized boys’ and girls’ clubs to “teach them how to manage, grow, and prepare market crops and animals and to demonstrate how to save surplus products by home canning.” Lest this language prove somewhat less than alluring, 4-H clubs, specifying “head, heart, health, and hands,” were born.\nFor more background on this episode, visit: https://vermonthistory.org/4-h-in-vermont-1914", "trackName":"Episode 8: 4-H in Vermont", "trackId":1000473252399, "feedUrl":"https://feed.podbean.com/vermonthistory/feed.xml", "artistIds":[],

"description":"In 1930, the Committee on Traditions and Ideals of the Vermont Commission on Country Life appointed Helen Hartness Flanders (1890-1972), of Springfield, Vermont, to spearhead a project to document the traditional music of Vermont. Mrs. Flanders, daughter of former Governor of Vermont James Hartness, and wife of Ralph Flanders, a leader in the Vermont machine-tool industry and later Republican Senator from Vermont from 1946-1959, was a trained musician, writer, and arts patron. With the assistance of George Brown of Boston, a member of the Springfield Symphony, Mrs. Flanders traveled throughout the state, sought out singers of old ballads, wrote down and, as technology developed from wax cylinder, to disk, to reel-to-reel magnetic tape, recorded traditional New England folksongs and ballads as sung by native Vermonters and other New Englanders.\nFor more background on this episode, please visit: https://vermonthistory.org/collecting-old-songs-helen-hartness-flanders-1930", "trackName":"Episode 25: Collecting Old Songs: Helen Hartness Flanders", "trackId":1000485229477, "feedUrl":"https://feed.podbean.com/vermonthistory/feed.xml", "artistIds":[],

"description":"Camp Vail was organized in the summer of 1917 because of wartime concern about an inadequate supply of farm labor within the state. To deal with the issue, the Vermont Farm War Council, composed of representatives of agricultural organizations and agencies in the state, appointed Frederick H. Bickford of Bradford as Farm Labor Agent. Bickford conceived the idea of creating a camp to train young Vermont boys in farm work as a means of helping assure an adequate work force at wage rates Vermont farmers could afford to pay. Camp Vail at Lyndon Center, Vermont, was the result. The location was a nearly 2,000-acre area on the farm of Theodore N. Vail, president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, near the site of present-day Lyndon State College.\nFor more background on this episode, visit: https://vermonthistory.org/world-war-i-camp-vail-1916", "trackName":"Episode 10: World War I & Camp Vail", "trackId":1000473977298, "feedUrl":"https://feed.podbean.com/vermonthistory/feed.xml", "artistIds":[],

"description":"The flood of November 3-4, 1927, stands as the greatest natural disaster in Vermont history. Devastation occurred throughout the state, with 1,285 bridges lost, countless homes and buildings destroyed, and hundreds of miles of roads and railroad tracks swept away. The flood waters claimed 84 lives, including that of the Vermont Lieutenant Governor at the time, S. Hollister Jackson. Rainfall during the month of October averaged about 150 percent of normal across the state. In northern and central sections, some places received 300 percent of normal. Heavy rainfall periods during October were separated enough so flooding did not occur. Instead, the rain caused the soil to become saturated. Combined with the lateness in the year and the fact that most vegetation was either in, or near, seasonal dormancy, any further rainfall would runoff directly into the rivers. This is exactly the scenario that led to Vermont's greatest disaster. Rain began on the evening of November 2, as a cold front moved into the area from the west. Rainfall continued through the night with light amounts being recorded by the morning of the 3rd. Rainfall intensity increased during the afternoon of the 3rd as a storm moved up along the east coast. This storm contained huge amounts of moisture associated with the remnants of a former tropical storm. A strong southeast flow developed off the Atlantic Ocean. This moisture-laden air was forced to rise as it encountered the Green Mountains, resulting in torrential downpours along and east of the Green Mountains on November 4.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.

Molly Gray by a margin of 24 points. If she wins the general election in November, Balint will become the first woman and the first openly gay person to represent Vermont in the U.S. Congress. Vermont is the only state that has never elected a woman to Congress. Becca Balint was born in a U.S. Army hospital in Germany where her father was stationed and grew up in upstate New York. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from Smith College, a master’s in education from Harvard and a master’s in history from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She came to Vermont in the 1990s to be a rock climbing instructor at the Farm and Wilderness Camp in Plymouth, where she met her future wife, attorney Elizabeth Wohl. Balint went on to become a middle school teacher and in 2014 was elected state senator from Windham County. She served as Senate majority leader and is currently the Senate president pro tempore.

"description":"A curious hallmark of the Covid-19 pandemic is the backlash that it has spawned. Right-wing politicians and their media allies are emboldened as they rage against masks and vaccines, spout conspiracy theories (https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/conspiracy-theories-misinformation-threaten-overtake-covid-fight-note/story?id=78718042) and attack doctors and scientists. Republican governors in Florida and Texas, where infections are raging among children, are blocking schools from mandating that children wear masks (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/14/desantis-abbott-biden-mask-mandate-challenges/), a simple public health measure. Those same states are reporting that their ICUs are full (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/17/us/covid-delta-hospitalizations.html), many of them with children.\nThis type of behavior is not new. The Anti-Vaccination League of America was founded in 1908 just as a vaccine against smallpox — a disease that had killed millions — was being mandated by some states, while mandates were prohibited by others.\nThe effort to blame China for the pandemic also has a familiar ring. “The idea of looking for scapegoats, of casting blame has taken on new life during Covid,” says Martin Halliwell, professor of American Studies at the University of Leicester in the UK. “Stigmatizing has a long narrative. There is a constant, the idea of looking for someone to blame.”\nMartin Halliwell (https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/english/people/martinhalliwell) tells the story of America’s social and political struggles around public health in his new book, American Health Crisis: 100 Years of Panic, Planning, and Politics (https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520379404/american-health-crisis).

Mike Clough from the Southern Vermont Natural History Museum is back to talk about the newest edition to the museum's educational animals. There are now live Virginia Opposum's at the museum, and they're part of a pilot program for the state of Vermont, exploring the possibilities of museums and nature centers keeping nonreleasable native mammals for educational purposes. Mike and I talk about the reasoning behind the experiment, how the Opossums ended up in our care, and a whole lot of interesting ecology as well. We also get into the benefits of live animal interactions for education and work going into expanding the museum in the future. It was a great conversation, I hope you enjoy it. \n\nLinks;\n\nSouthern Vermont Natural History Museum\n\nBlog Post About The Opossums",

"description":"Vermont’s housing crunch is nothing new. For decades, Vermont has looked for housing solutions to create “perpetual affordability” for our communities. Yet here we are, with rental vacancy rates at 3.4% in VT at large, 1.9% in Chittenden County, and a squeezed 1.5% in Burlington, according to VHFA. More troubling is that 48% of renters in Vermont are cost burdened – paying more than 30% of their income for housing. This is the 12th highest percentage in the nation. And among homeowners, 27% of those with mortgages are cost burdened, the 7th highest percentage in the nation.\n\nHow did we get here? \n\nIn our latest episode, we examine the history of Community Land Trusts (CLTs) in Vermont, taking some time to contrast policies in the 1980s, the age of Reaganomics, when under Bernie Sanders, Burlington gave the US its first municipality-funded CLT. We examine their legacy, arguing that while CHT was meant to defend affordable housing and radically challenge the capitalist hegemony, it instead operates as a “nickel and dime real estate agency,” a slightly more beneficent landlord, and ultimately an accomplice to gentrification. Their initial mission has been lost in the “unholy alliances” CHT has had to make as it has become part of the landscape of Vermont housing.", "trackName":"Vermont History: Community Land Trusts", "trackId":1000512309826, "feedUrl":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:842076505/sounds.rss", "artistIds":[], "shortDescription":"Vermont’s housing crunch is nothing new.

"description":"On October 19, 1864, a band of 21 Confederates raided the prosperous little Vermont Town of St. Albans, robbing their three banks, bullying and then shooting three citizens, one fatally, stealing horses, and attempting to set fire to the town, before escaping with an estimated $200,000 in paper and gold coin, destined for the Confederate treasury in Richmond, VA. Some cash and coin were found spilled along the way. However, during the pursuit, according to legend that prevails to this day, a large stash of gold was buried under a large flat rick in a section of pine woods just off the trail leading to the Canadian border.
